1)Security in AWS

Ans: It is same a firewall. Contains set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of EC2 instance.




2)Storage
Ans: It is kind of similar to Google Drive, but way much powerful   
     We can create folders in it, and can even host websites.
     But we can only host static websites, if we want to host dynamic websites, we will
     have to create the website using 'React' technology.
