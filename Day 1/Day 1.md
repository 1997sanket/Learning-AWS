* **Cloud according to me** 

Cloud in laymans term is pay and go services one gets on rent via internet, which if we go through traditional
methods would require a large amount of money and management.

For eg: I want to use some operating system/Database or want a virtual PC, then i just go to cloud
select the service I want and start using it. Now the cloud will charge me with the intensity with
which I am using the service and for the amount of time I'm using it.

Now by doing this, i dont have to worry about paying for licensed products (AWS takes care of that), 
actual data center, managing the data center, electricty, internet, security etc. 

Now just how great that is ????? seriously 
Its heaven for startups. With just few click we are able to use various types of services with
relatabily very small amount. It's actually win win for both AWS and the user.
